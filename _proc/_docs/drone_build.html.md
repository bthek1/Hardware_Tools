# Drone Build


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

## **1. Quadcopter Frame**

- **Frame Size**: Choose based on your requirements (racing, freestyle,
  camera drone). Common sizes are 150mm (micro), 250mm
  (freestyle/racing), 450mm (camera/freestyle).
- **Material**: Carbon fiber is lightweight and durable. Avoid plastic
  unless for toy drones.
- **Mounting**: Ensure the frame supports the components you’re planning
  to use (motor mounting pattern, flight controller size, etc.).

## **2. Motors**

- **Motor Size**: Defined by numbers (e.g., 2205). First two digits
  refer to the stator diameter; the second two are stator height.
- **KV Rating**: Determines motor speed. Higher KV = faster motor, but
  less torque. Choose based on propeller size and battery.
- **Type**: Brushless motors are most common due to efficiency and
  durability.

## **3. Electronic Speed Controllers (ESC)**

- **Amperage Rating**: Choose ESCs that support the motor’s current draw
  (check motor datasheets). Add a 20-30% safety margin.
- **Number of ESCs**: 4 individual ESCs or a 4-in-1 ESC board. 4-in-1
  simplifies wiring but may be harder to replace individually.
- **Firmware**: BLHeli_S or BLHeli_32 are common for advanced features
  and performance

## **4. Flight Controller (FC)**

- **Processor**: F7 or F4 processors are common. F7 provides more
  future-proofing and features.
- **Gyros**: Look for FCs with high-performance gyros for smoother
  flight. MPU6000 is reliable for most builds.
- **UART Ports**: Ensure enough ports for your accessories like GPS,
  telemetry, and receiver.
- **Firmware**: Betaflight or iNav for FPV racing/freestyle, or
  ArduPilot for more advanced features.

## **5. Propellers**

- **Size**: Propeller size should match the motor and frame size. Common
  sizes are 5-inch for freestyle and racing, 6-8 inch for medium, and
  larger for camera drones.
- **Pitch**: A higher pitch increases speed but reduces flight time.
  Choose based on your flying style.
- **Material**: Nylon with glass fiber is durable and affordable.

## **6. Battery (LiPo)**

- **Cell Count**: Defined as 3S, 4S, etc. More cells mean higher voltage
  (3S = 11.1V, 4S = 14.8V).
- **Capacity (mAh)**: Larger capacity gives longer flight time but
  increases weight. Balance capacity with weight for your drone size.
- **C Rating**: Defines discharge rate. Higher C rating = more current
  output. Choose at least 30C-50C for racing drones.

## **7. Radio Transmitter & Receiver**

- **Channels**: At least 6-8 channels are recommended for basic drone
  control.
- **Range**: Choose a transmitter with sufficient range (consider 2.4GHz
  or long-range 915MHz systems for FPV).
- **Receiver Type**: FrSky, FlySky, Spektrum, or Crossfire depending on
  your preferred brand and features.

## **8. FPV Camera & Video Transmitter (VTX)**

- **FPV Camera**: Look for low-latency cameras with high-resolution
  (600TVL to 1200TVL) for a clear FPV feed.
- **Video Transmitter (VTX)**: Choose based on the required range (25mW
  for short-range, 200-600mW for longer ranges).
- **VTX Band**: Make sure your VTX operates on legal frequencies in your
  country (typically 5.8GHz).

## **9. GPS Module (optional)**

- **Purpose**: Adds features like Return-to-Home (RTH) and position
  hold. Essential for camera drones and advanced features.
- **Compatibility**: Ensure it’s compatible with your flight controller
  firmware.

## **10. Power Distribution Board (PDB)**

- **Current Rating**: Ensure it supports the combined current draw of
  all your components.
- **Built-in Features**: Some PDBs come with built-in voltage regulators
  or OSD (On-Screen Display) for telemetry.

## **11. Miscellaneous Parts**

- **LEDs**: For night flying or visibility.
- **Buzzer**: Helps locate the drone in case of a crash.
- **XT60 Connectors**: Common connectors for LiPo batteries.
