    "## **1. Quadcopter Frame**\n",
    "   - **Frame Size**: Choose based on your requirements (racing, freestyle, camera drone). Common sizes are 150mm (micro), 250mm (freestyle/racing), 450mm (camera/freestyle).\n",
    "   - **Material**: Carbon fiber is lightweight and durable. Avoid plastic unless for toy drones.\n",
    "   - **Mounting**: Ensure the frame supports the components you're planning to use (motor mounting pattern, flight controller size, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Motors**\n",
    "   - **Motor Size**: Defined by numbers (e.g., 2205). First two digits refer to the stator diameter; the second two are stator height.\n",
    "   - **KV Rating**: Determines motor speed. Higher KV = faster motor, but less torque. Choose based on propeller size and battery.\n",
    "   - **Type**: Brushless motors are most common due to efficiency and durability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Electronic Speed Controllers (ESC)**\n",
    "   - **Amperage Rating**: Choose ESCs that support the motor's current draw (check motor datasheets). Add a 20-30% safety margin.\n",
    "   - **Number of ESCs**: 4 individual ESCs or a 4-in-1 ESC board. 4-in-1 simplifies wiring but may be harder to replace individually.\n",
    "   - **Firmware**: BLHeli_S or BLHeli_32 are common for advanced features and performance\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Flight Controller (FC)**\n",
    "   - **Processor**: F7 or F4 processors are common. F7 provides more future-proofing and features.\n",
    "   - **Gyros**: Look for FCs with high-performance gyros for smoother flight. MPU6000 is reliable for most builds.\n",
    "   - **UART Ports**: Ensure enough ports for your accessories like GPS, telemetry, and receiver.\n",
    "   - **Firmware**: Betaflight or iNav for FPV racing/freestyle, or ArduPilot for more advanced features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Propellers**\n",
    "   - **Size**: Propeller size should match the motor and frame size. Common sizes are 5-inch for freestyle and racing, 6-8 inch for medium, and larger for camera drones.\n",
    "   - **Pitch**: A higher pitch increases speed but reduces flight time. Choose based on your flying style.\n",
    "   - **Material**: Nylon with glass fiber is durable and affordable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Battery (LiPo)**\n",
    "   - **Cell Count**: Defined as 3S, 4S, etc. More cells mean higher voltage (3S = 11.1V, 4S = 14.8V).\n",
    "   - **Capacity (mAh)**: Larger capacity gives longer flight time but increases weight. Balance capacity with weight for your drone size.\n",
    "   - **C Rating**: Defines discharge rate. Higher C rating = more current output. Choose at least 30C-50C for racing drones.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **7. Radio Transmitter & Receiver**\n",
    "   - **Channels**: At least 6-8 channels are recommended for basic drone control.\n",
    "   - **Range**: Choose a transmitter with sufficient range (consider 2.4GHz or long-range 915MHz systems for FPV).\n",
    "   - **Receiver Type**: FrSky, FlySky, Spektrum, or Crossfire depending on your preferred brand and features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **8. FPV Camera & Video Transmitter (VTX)**\n",
    "   - **FPV Camera**: Look for low-latency cameras with high-resolution (600TVL to 1200TVL) for a clear FPV feed.\n",
    "   - **Video Transmitter (VTX)**: Choose based on the required range (25mW for short-range, 200-600mW for longer ranges).\n",
    "   - **VTX Band**: Make sure your VTX operates on legal frequencies in your country (typically 5.8GHz).\n",
    "\n",
    "## **9. GPS Module (optional)**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Adds features like Return-to-Home (RTH) and position hold. Essential for camera drones and advanced features.\n",
    "   - **Compatibility**: Ensure it's compatible with your flight controller firmware.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **10. Power Distribution Board (PDB)**\n",
    "   - **Current Rating**: Ensure it supports the combined current draw of all your components.\n",
    "   - **Built-in Features**: Some PDBs come with built-in voltage regulators or OSD (On-Screen Display) for telemetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **11. Miscellaneous Parts**\n",
    "   - **LEDs**: For night flying or visibility.\n",
    "   - **Buzzer**: Helps locate the drone in case of a crash.\n",
    "   - **XT60 Connectors**: Common connectors for LiPo batteries."
