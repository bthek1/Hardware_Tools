## **1. Quadcopter Frame**
   - **Frame Size**: Choose based on your requirements (racing, freestyle, camera drone). Common sizes are 150mm (micro), 250mm (freestyle/racing), 450mm (camera/freestyle).
   - **Material**: Carbon fiber is lightweight and durable. Avoid plastic unless for toy drones.
   - **Mounting**: Ensure the frame supports the components you're planning to use (motor mounting pattern, flight controller size, etc.).

## **2. Motors**
   - **Motor Size**: Defined by numbers (e.g., 2205). First two digits refer to the stator diameter; the second two are stator height.
   - **KV Rating**: Determines motor speed. Higher KV = faster motor, but less torque. Choose based on propeller size and battery.
   - **Type**: Brushless motors are most common due to efficiency and durability.

## **3. Electronic Speed Controllers (ESC)**
   - **Amperage Rating**: Choose ESCs that support the motor's current draw (check motor datasheets). Add a 20-30% safety margin.
   - **Number of ESCs**: 4 individual ESCs or a 4-in-1 ESC board. 4-in-1 simplifies wiring but may be harder to replace individually.
   - **Firmware**: BLHeli_S or BLHeli_32 are common for advanced features and performance

## **4. Flight Controller (FC)**
   - **Processor**: F7 or F4 processors are common. F7 provides more future-proofing and features.
   - **Gyros**: Look for FCs with high-performance gyros for smoother flight. MPU6000 is reliable for most builds.
   - **UART Ports**: Ensure enough ports for your accessories like GPS, telemetry, and receiver.
   - **Firmware**: Betaflight or iNav for FPV racing/freestyle, or ArduPilot for more advanced features.

## **5. Propellers**
   - **Size**: Propeller size should match the motor and frame size. Common sizes are 5-inch for freestyle and racing, 6-8 inch for medium, and larger for camera drones.
   - **Pitch**: A higher pitch increases speed but reduces flight time. Choose based on your flying style.
   - **Material**: Nylon with glass fiber is durable and affordable.

## **6. Battery (LiPo)**
   - **Cell Count**: Defined as 3S, 4S, etc. More cells mean higher voltage (3S = 11.1V, 4S = 14.8V).
   - **Capacity (mAh)**: Larger capacity gives longer flight time but increases weight. Balance capacity with weight for your drone size.
   - **C Rating**: Defines discharge rate. Higher C rating = more current output. Choose at least 30C-50C for racing drones.

## **7. Radio Transmitter & Receiver**
   - **Channels**: At least 6-8 channels are recommended for basic drone control.
   - **Range**: Choose a transmitter with sufficient range (consider 2.4GHz or long-range 915MHz systems for FPV).
   - **Receiver Type**: FrSky, FlySky, Spektrum, or Crossfire depending on your preferred brand and features.

## **8. FPV Camera & Video Transmitter (VTX)**
   - **FPV Camera**: Look for low-latency cameras with high-resolution (600TVL to 1200TVL) for a clear FPV feed.
   - **Video Transmitter (VTX)**: Choose based on the required range (25mW for short-range, 200-600mW for longer ranges).
   - **VTX Band**: Make sure your VTX operates on legal frequencies in your country (typically 5.8GHz).

## **9. GPS Module (optional)**
   - **Purpose**: Adds features like Return-to-Home (RTH) and position hold. Essential for camera drones and advanced features.
   - **Compatibility**: Ensure it's compatible with your flight controller firmware.

## **10. Power Distribution Board (PDB)**
   - **Current Rating**: Ensure it supports the combined current draw of all your components.
   - **Built-in Features**: Some PDBs come with built-in voltage regulators or OSD (On-Screen Display) for telemetry.

## **11. Miscellaneous Parts**
   - **LEDs**: For night flying or visibility.
   - **Buzzer**: Helps locate the drone in case of a crash.
   - **XT60 Connectors**: Common connectors for LiPo batteries.
